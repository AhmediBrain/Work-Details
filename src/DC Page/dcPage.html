                        We are excited to announce that iBRAIN is expanding to the Washington, 
                        DC Metro area and we are currently evaluating potential students as well as hiring full-time staff.
                    </p>

                        We put together a comprehensive brochure outlining the services iBRAIN will be delivering to students who are non-verbal and non-ambulatory and are within a 90-minute drive to downtown Washington, 
                        DC (see brochure here: INSERT LINK)
                    </p>
                    <p>
